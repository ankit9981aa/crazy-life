Every stage of a company's growth benefits from the cloud. However, small to midsize businesses may find it to be particularly beneficial. Many obstacles that may not be experienced by larger enterprises in their industry are frequently faced by small businesses and startups. These organizations may not be able to budget for an increased IT team, updated software, and the necessary hardware due to their low resources and extremely localized activities. The time and money spent on employee training and routine software and hardware updates are examples of additional costs.

When computing operations are localized, networking and collaboration become laborious and time-consuming, and small businesses are less able to access the resources of a global workforce of independent contractors to handle sporadic or project-related staff needs. This can have an impact on both productivity and competitiveness. And while a company website might serve as a platform for communication with clients and customers, it might lack the capacity for round-the-clock responsiveness and full access to all of the firm's data and human resources.

These issues can be resolved, money can be saved, productivity can be increased, and the environment can be protected at the same time by moving some or all of a company's computing requirements to the cloud. There is a cloud — or clouds — to suit the needs of almost every organization, with a variety of cloud service options and price plans available.

### The Top 5 Benefits of Cloud Hosting



#### 1. Safety

Data storage in the cloud helps guard against criminal activity, inadvertent loss, and natural disasters like fires, floods, and earthquakes. Cloud storage, in particular dedicated server hosting, gives consumers access to a cloud provider's own security measures to guard against cybercrime and other security risks. Data migration to the cloud provides sensitive information with resources that are beyond the reach of countermeasures that can be taken on local networks, protecting it from physical damage, human error, and cyberthreats. Users still need to implement their own protections, such as managing passwords and permissions.

Additionally, while employing a cloud hosting company, skilled experts are in charge of overall data protection. They can scale resources as necessary, install associated security technologies, and maybe provide extra login security measures like Multi-Factor Authentication. The hardware for cloud servers is often kept physically in extremely secure off-site data centers as well.

#### 2. Flexibility and Scalability

Cloud service options range from straightforward public cloud bundles to fully managed custom cloud solutions created to address particular needs. These can be adjusted to accommodate a company's shifting priorities and ongoing growth.

The public cloud, a cost-effective option that enables many users to share the same servers provided by the remote host, private clouds dedicated to just one user, hybrid- or multi-cloud options that can be a combination of cloud and local computing, or a collection of cloud services dedicated to supporting various functions are among the options.

Users can scale their cloud service plans to incorporate more storage, more applications, and additional host-provided services as their businesses expand. To address changing needs, one option could be to use a private- or multi-cloud solution.

The majority of cloud services provide a menu of "pay as you go" services so that customers can choose different plans or add new features as needed without making a commitment or incurring additional costs. Users only pay for the services they really utilize because plans can be expanded or lowered as needed.

#### 3. Backups of data

on the case of a disaster, you can relax knowing backups are available when you save your Sage or QuickBooks data on the cloud. Automated data backups often occur every day. Therefore, if you fail to make a copy of your data at the conclusion of a long workday, it won't be the end of the world. At Summit Hosting, we provide nightly data backups with a 15-day retention period.

#### 4. Investing

Think about your existing IT expenses. Those hardware and local storage devices don't take care of themselves, do they? If you want to develop your firm, you'll also need to upgrade your hardware and data storage, especially if you're using a more sophisticated version of Sage. Your IT department will now be responsible for maintaining and updating your local machines as a result of this expansion. Money also comes with that responsibility.

Smaller IT organizations may find it expensive and stressful to manage a dense network of storage/service devices and other IT infrastructure. Your investment in IT infrastructure will be reduced, and the workload of your internal IT staff will be significantly reduced, if you offload the storage and performance requirements of your business apps.

In addition to risk aversion, the cloud hosting provider may also take care of all of your company's storage needs in terms of backups, maintenance, and updates. So, the choice is between possibly risky, outdated, and expensive and keeping your data secure, your software updated, and your prices low.

#### 5. Practicality and Cooperation

When data and applications are restricted to local systems, access is frequently constrained to specific windows of time and situations. However, the cloud eliminates time and geographic restrictions, making data and services accessible at all times from any location in the world.

The ability to collaborate across time zones and countries, deliver round-the-clock customer care, and react rapidly to any scenario is made possible by the ability for any user with permissions and a connected device to access company data stored in the cloud. Documents can be shared and changed in real-time from remote places all over the world if there is continuous operation and constant access to necessary data/software. No matter where you are, you can access your QuickBooks or Sage data instantly on your computer or in the palm of your hand thanks to the cloud.
