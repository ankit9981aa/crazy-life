A retirement calculator can help you calculate a number of things. It can help you determine the amount of money you should be investing or saving each month for your retirement. It helps you pick suitable investment options based on the expected returns on your investment.

Additionally, the calculator also helps you understand the effect of inflation on your savings, so that you can adjust your budget and plan accordingly. Lastly, the retirement calculator gives you an estimate of your post-retirement income.

**Are you saving enough for your retirement?**

Retirement expenses can be relatively lower than your pre-retirement expenses, but they are still a large amount. Inflation, rising healthcare needs, financial emergencies and expenses like home repairs, travel, essentials and more can pose concerns in retirement.

Therefore, it is important to save enough. You can use a retirement calculator when planning for your retirement to understand how much money you would need. Accordingly, you can build a nest egg that can last you a lifetime. 

## Why should I have a retirement plan?

A retirement plan helps to ensure a stress-free and comfortable post-retirement life. It enables you to protect your future financial interests and ensure the security of your loved ones in case of an unfortunate event. It makes sense to start reaping the power of compounding early on and getting the most out of it by retirement.

## What is a retirement corpus?

A retirement corpus is the total fund you accumulate to meet your financial requirements post-retirement. This should be a financial reserve you can fall on, that can not only cover your day-to-day expenses but also take care of unexpected emergencies.
