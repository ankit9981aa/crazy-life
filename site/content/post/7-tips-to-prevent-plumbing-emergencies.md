Like most homeowners, a plumbing system is often taken for granted until it stops working correctly. There is nothing like a burst pipe or a backed-up toilet to get a homeowner’s attention. This kind of plumbing emergency is not just inconvenient but also costly to fix. Maintaining the plumbing system rather than calling an emergency plumber to help with a plumbing disaster makes much more sense.

## 1) Search for leaks

Check fixtures regularly and look for unexplained increases in a home’s water bill, most probably caused by water leaks. If a leak is found, be sure to fix the problem right away. Even if the most minor leak is neglected, it can result in a larger problem in the future. Other warning signs include a toilet rocking on its base and indications of moisture like peeling paint, stained walls, and unexplained musty doors.

## 2) Take care of a home’s toilets

Nothing should be placed in a toilet except toilet paper and human waste. Don’t put a plumbing system at risk by flushing diapers, leftover food, feminine hygiene products, or even a dead goldfish. Pouring fats and oils down the toilet or garbage disposal is also not recommended, as grease can cause problems with the plumbing pipes.

## 3) Be kind to a kitchen garbage disposal

Be cautious with what is put down a garbage disposal to avoid clogs in the machine. Fruits and bones are too hard; artichoke leaves, celery stalks, as well as corn husks are too stringy; rice, pasta, and oatmeal are too starchy; metal, plastic, and other non-food items can be dangerous.

A kitchen garbage disposal can handle smaller amounts of food found in mixing bowls and on dinner dishes. The rest have to go in the garbage can or the compost pile.

## 4) Purchase sink strainers

Purchasing sink strainers for a bathroom and kitchen is ideal for preventing hair and other debris falling down the drain and causing blockages to the plumbing pipes.

## 5) Don’t treat clogged drains with harsh chemicals

Chemicals are too hard on plumbing pipes and are not recommended to unclog drains. Instead, use a plunger or a drain snake as an alternative to dislodge minor drain clogs. Any severe clogs need to be addressed by a licensed emergency plumber.

## 6) Drain water heater tanks to remove sediment build-up

Don’t forget to turn off the gas or electricity, as well as the cold water supply valve of the heater, first. Check the tank monthly for drips or other plumbing issues.

## 7) Locate the main shutoff valve

A plumbing system’s main shutoff valve is usually located near the water meter, which is found in front of the home. Turn off the water supply in case of an overflowing appliance or a broken pipe to prevent a small problem from becoming more significant while waiting for an emergency plumber.
