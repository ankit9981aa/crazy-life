  Mental Health Benefits of Having Sex
---
Let’s now talk about the adrenal system. Recall that endorphins, our body’s natural pleasure chemicals, are released at orgasm. Being that their very nature is to boost happiness, it should come as no surprise that an active sex life can benefit mental health. Endorphins released during sex combat anxiety and relieve stress, both of which are prime suspects when it comes to feeling less than satisfied with our lives. 

Going through a rough patch with your significant other? There may actually be something behind the theory of “make-up sex;” namely that studies have shown sexual intercourse can increase levels of trust and intimacy in our relationships. There’s hardly anything more intimate than working together toward a common goal, and apparently when that goal is sex, the repercussions can lead to a healthier partnership. Sex also makes it easier for couples to perceive, identify, and express their emotions, leading to better communication patterns and empathy. 

Ever walk into a room and forget what you were looking for? Perhaps it was more sex. One of the most unexpected mental benefits of regular intercourse is improved memory. One study concerning adults aged between 50 and 90 found better memory function among those who were sexually active – at ages across the spectrum. Those same individuals were also less likely to report feelings of depression or loneliness. 

It seems that sex should be a part of your routine for well into your golden years.

## Sex Is Good For Your Health

No matter how you measure your health, generally speaking, more sex will help to improve it. The benefits of regular intercourse begin inside and lead to positive benefits that ripple outward like waves and return. It’s a relatively simple formula:

1. Sex can improve your mental and physical condition
2. Your mental and physical conditions can improve your relationships
3. Your relationships can improve your overall wellbeing, and lead to more sex
4. Rinse, lather, repeat (whether with a partner or by yourself)

Sex has long been about far more than procreation – and it is time to give everyone’s favorite bedroom activity its proper due as an addition to a fulfilling and healthy lifestyle.
